# Development status

The rearchitecture is on `refactor/separate-apps-and-ci-20261025` in draft
[PR #2](https://github.com/I-am-drunk/framerize/pull/2). It is not deployed.

## Implemented

- Separate browser and native applications in one Cargo workspace.
- Native code grouped by account, authorization, request, transport and worker.
- Browser, native and shared Python runtime packages with explicit entry points.
- Durable account history, exclusive profile ownership and joined shutdown.
- Complete archives with verification, staging and compatible-package rollback.
- A native ledger process that retains its session owner until the child exits.
- Native service state and admission without a browser bridge or browser router.

The retired host patchers, combined-mode checkers and their private tests are
removed. Current tests stay with the behavior they exercise.

## Validation

The complete browser and native development archives at `2410dac` pass
verification and staging. Browser startup, signal shutdown and profile
exclusion pass. The native archive starts and joins its packaged ledger.

The native admission separation passes all 24 current native service cases and
all 226 remaining browser-server cases. Both debug executables build. The first
compile identified a private method moved across the crate boundary; exposing
that unchanged registration method resolved it.

The prior 288 native results and 110 Python results cover unchanged code.
Four obsolete combined-mode native cases were replaced by four admission
cases; two independent browser health cases were retained. Removed tests do
not count as validation of the new structure. No live delivery is claimed.

## Remaining work

The native CLI validates worker configuration only. Standalone startup must
acquire session and journal ownership together, connect the qualified worker,
and join all request and child-process cleanup before releasing those owners.
V2 still requires its authenticated SDK proof; no fallback substitutes for it.

First migration of legacy account history remains unresolved. The working
browser service and its account state have not been changed by this rewrite.

The requested alternate GitHub account (`diddletime`) and private build fork
are configured. Both available accounts have Actions billing restrictions;
no hosted build has succeeded.
